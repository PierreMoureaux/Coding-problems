Daily coding problems (list from https://github.com/LechGrzelak/Daily-Coding-Problems) with my own codes

Codes will be in C++ an python with following constraints, that I'll try to match as much as possible:

C++
1/Generic code (templates etc...)
2/Use of stl features (algorithms etc...)
3/If needed, use of non-standard libraries (Eigen etc...)

Python
1/Use loop as little as possible (vectorization)
2/Use of standard library (numpy, linalg etc...)
