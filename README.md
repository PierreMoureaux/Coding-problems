I/Daily coding problems

-Daily coding problems (list from https://github.com/LechGrzelak/Daily-Coding-Problems) with my own codes
-Codes will be in C++ an python with following constraints, that I'll try to match as much as possible:

-C++

-1/Generic code (templates etc...)
-2/Use of stl features (algorithms etc...)
-3/If needed, use of non-standard libraries (Eigen etc...)
-4/Use of modern c++ features, starrting from C++11

-Python

-1/Use loop as little as possible (vectorization)
-2/Use of standard library (numpy, linalg etc...)

II/Quant coding problems
